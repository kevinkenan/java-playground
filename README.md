# java-playground

Code inspired by *Effective Java* by Joshua Bloch and *Java Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases* by Joshua Bloch and Neal Gafter. This repo is oranized into a series of examples in no particular order. Notes about each example are included in the docs directory and on my [blog][blog].

## List of Examples

  * [Example 1: Overriding Instance Methods in Java][ex1]
  * [Example 2: Hiding Static Methods in Java][ex2]
  * [Example 3: The Irrelevancy of References in Static Method Invocation][ex3]
  * [Example 4: The Irreversibility of Overrides and Uncovering Hidden Fields][ex4]
